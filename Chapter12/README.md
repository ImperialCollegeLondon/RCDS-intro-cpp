## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Jes√∫s Urtasun Elizari - University of Milan - 2019/20

**Subject:** Object Oriented Programming in C++

Before starting we suggest to create a folder for Chapter 12 where you can save all files that will be created for the exercise
```bash
cd ~/           # go the home directory
mkdir Chapter12  # create the directory Chapter12 in home
cd Chapter12     # go inside Chapter12
```
Create a `makefile` to compile all exercises

## Exercise 1 - Classes and methods

Write a **C++ program** in an OOP paradigm.

1. Write an abstract class Animal with name, height and weight as attributes:

2. Write the methods for the class animal and insantiate an animal in the main function with the following attributes (...)

2. Build a cat object by writing an inherited classes from Animal.

3. Test the implementation in a main function.

## Exercise 2 - Inheritance

Write a **C++ program** in an OOP paradigm.

1. Write an abstract class Warrior and another Battle. Both with the folling attributes (...)
