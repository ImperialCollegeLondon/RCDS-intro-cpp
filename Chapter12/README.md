Before starting we suggest to create a folder for Lesson 4 where you can save all files that will be created for the exercise
```bash
cd ~/           # go the home directory
mkdir Chapter12  # create the directory Chapter12 in home
cd Chapter12     # go inside Chapter12
```
Create a `makefile` to compile all exercises
